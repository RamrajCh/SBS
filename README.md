The age where we can find everything in one place for shopping, a supermarket,
has been seen to grow throughout the world. Our country also has growing
supermarkets in the urban areas as well as suburban areas. Bills are the major thing
in keeping records of sales and without it the company would not know how it is
performing and how the transactions are being made. But in case of small
supermarkets that have just been evolve in market are lagging behind in business
due to lack of billing softwares.
Our project Supermarket Billing System help in the making of transaction of
goods quicker and effective. This system will help to manage all types of
accounting related to shopping in supermarkets and help in managing inventory
of the supermarket. it is made by the use of C++ programming language in QT
Creator IDE with the concept of invoice generator.
The main purpose of this project is to provide cashier a easy and interactive
environment for creating bills in supermarket and managing the transactions so
that the money and customer flow will be known easily to the owners and
employees with good security, with less error calculation and easy data access and
reduction of paper.
The expected outcome is an application software as a service, that will fit into the
system of supermarket management for more productivity in the accounting,
tracking cashiers and create easier task for cashiers, also helping in proper
management of cash flow in the supermarket.
